## Overview

Turntable has three components:

1. **Vinyl** - a python framework for building and managing analytics infrastructure.
2. **Midi AI (coming soon)** - an AI data analyst assistant that works with Vinyl to help you with basic analysis tasks and surface insights in record time.
3. **Turntable Cloud** - managed CPU and GPU compute to help you run intensive data workloads and sub second queries.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that analytics infrastructure should:

- Be declarative and code-backed
- Embeddable in the latest BI tools and data products
- Leverage AI to help surface insights and automate repetitive tasks
- Be scalable, cost-effective and use the latest query engines for sub second queries
