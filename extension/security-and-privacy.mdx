## Privacy

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What data do you collect by default?">


Our general approach is to collect as **little data as possible** to provide you with our service. For the VSCode extension, we do not collect or store your data warehouse credentials or your data. We are able to do this while still providing our services by instructing your computer to run dbt commands locally.


Here is exactly what we collect, who we send it to, and why:


| What we process                                                            | Who we send it to                       | Why we collect it                                     | What we do to protect your data                                                          |
