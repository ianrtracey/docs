<Accordion title = "How does Turntable protect my data and privacy?">

<Accordion title="Is Turntable open-source? If so, where can I find the source code?">

Turntable is not currently open-source, but we are actively considering making it so. If youâ€™d like to see us open-source our product, we'd love to hear from you.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Whatâ€™s Turntableâ€™s pricing?">


We are currently in a closed beta. Our extension is free, and we plan to always have free tier. We hope youâ€™ll pay us in feedback ðŸ™‚.

<Accordion title="Do you plan to expand to other platforms beyond web and the VSCode extension?">


We are considering a desktop app, but have no firm plans yet. If youâ€™re interested, drop us a line and be sure to let us know why itâ€™d be valuable to you!

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I share this with my friends and colleagues?">

The easiest thing to do is to send them [our website link](https://www.turntable.so/). They will be able to download the VSCode extension directly from there, or reach out to us to find time to set up the Cloud product.
