## Key things to know

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What is column-level lineage (CLL)?">

Column-level lineage is a more nuanced visualization of your [DAG](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dag) that accounts for the connections between _columns_ in each table in your data warehouse, not just tables. 
</Accordion>



<Accordion title="How can I use CLL right now to improve my dbt workflow?">

- _**Debugging:**_ CLL can dramatically accelerate the debugging process by giving you visibility into how a column is calculated without having to go line-by-line through each model.
- _**Knowledge sharing & discussion:**_ CLL can make it easier for data team members to get up to speed on a new data table. We’ve found it makes a great visual for bug bashes, demos, and a variety of internal meeting use cases.
</Accordion>



<Accordion title="How is CLL calculated?">


Most vendors who offer CLL use batch metadata syncs from your cloud warehouse provider to generate it. This is effective but quite slow. As a result, lineage is often only recalculated once per day.


Turntable takes a different approach. We convert your dbt code into sql abstract syntax (using [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot)) and leverage our own algorithm to recurse the syntax tree and build CLL.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="What connection types are possible between columns?">


With table lineage, tables are either connected or they are not. With CLL, connections are more nuanced. Here are the main types, and how they are represented in the extension:


| Category          | Edge type                 | Description                                                                                         | Common sql keywords          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Calculation logic | Select as is              | Column is selected exactly as is                                                                    | SELECT                       |
| Calculation logic | Select with modifications | Column is selected but with transformations, such as changing, type, changing alias, or aggregating | SELECT, CAST, AS, SUM, COUNT |
| Values included   | Filter                    | Rows of a given column are excluded via a predicated statement                                      | WHERE, HAVING, QUALIFY       |
| Values included   | Join Key                  | Rows of a given column are excluded based on join keys                                              | ON, USING                    |
| Values included   | Group by                  | Rows of a given column are excluded based on column grouping                                        | GROUP BY                     |


<Warning>

One important caveat: two columns can — and often are — connected by multiple edges. This primarily occurs primarily when a query includes multiple CTEs. In these cases, we take the _union_ of all edge types involved in our visualization. More on this on the next page.

<Accordion title="What are the limitations of your approach?">


| Limitation                                                                                                     | Impact                                                                    | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                               |

| We depend on the `catalog.json` file to help with resolve column references.                                   | We may show missing/incomplete columns in some situations.                | - Make sure you have the credentials to run `dbt docs generate` for your project.<br/>- Make sure you materialize models (i.e. `dbt run`) and their ancestors if you make code updates.  |
| If we can’t parse your sql, we can’t generate column lineage.                                                  | We may only have table-level lineage for some tables.                     | - Qualify your columns (e.g. [`table.id`](http://table.id/) instead of `id` when there are multiple joins).<br/>- Report any issues to us. We can work to make library changes upstream. |
| We currently cannot correctly parse situations where your table reference is a function (e.g. UNNEST clauses). | We may show incomplete lineage in these cases.                            | - Use SELECT statements where possible.<br/>- Report any issues to us. We will prioritize this once we have enough demand.                                                               |
| We only support Bigquery and Snowflake.                                                                        | You may not be able to use this feature if your company uses another CDW. | - Drop us a line in our company slack or simply click the `chat with us` button to let us know. We’d love to your help in prioritizing which dbs to support next!                        |

<Accordion title="What improvements do you plan to make to this over time?">

- _**Better dialect coverage:**_ we plan to expand our solution to Databricks, Redshift, Starburst/Trino, and others going forward.
- _**Better syntax coverage:**_ our goal is 99+% coverage of sql syntax in our supported dialects
- _**New features based on CLL:**_ we are actively working on new features that leverage CLL for a better experience, including breaking change detection and column auto-renaming.

## Worked example


<Note>

Below is the code for an example dbt model called `current_pipeline`. See the toggle below for its column-level lineage. We’ve hidden it in case you want to try to work through the answer yourself first!

</Note>




```sql title="models/marts/sales/current_pipeline.sql"
select 
  r.pipeline_id,
  r.stage_id,
  s.order_nr as stage_order,
  coalesce(r.funnel_size,0) as funnel_size
from {{ ref('base_pipedrive__stage') }} s
left join {{ ref('ranked_deals') }} r on r.stage_id = s.id
where r.pipeline_id = 1
order by s.order_nr desc
```
