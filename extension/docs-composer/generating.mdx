## Instructions


To generate documentation, click the `ðŸª„Â Autofill` button. This will prompt you to select the model and column descriptions you want to update. By default, all fields without current descriptions will be selected. After selecting the desired fields, click `OK` and watch as our AI generates a first draft of the descriptions for you! Once the content is generated, review it and make any necessary adjustments. Finally, click `Save` to save the changes in your YAML files.
