## Viewing documentation


To view documentation, simply navigate to a model within your project. The extension pane will automatically change to show the relevant model and column descriptions.


<Accordion title="Walkthrough">

<iframe 
    background= "black"
    width= "100%"
    height= "350px"
    allowTransparency="true"
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/nn6CFy3jeQCh3Q1y9ho4?embed"
    allowFullScreen

/>
</Accordion>


<Note>

On startup, you may see a loading screen for a few seconds. Our extension needs both the `catalog.json` and `manifest.json` to work, so it needs to create these files by instructing your machine to run dbt commands.

</Note>




## Editing documentation

To edit documentation, make changes to the model and column description fields in the extension pane, and then press `Save`. Your updates will be automatically saved to the correct YAML file, or a new one will be created if necessary. After saving, you will see a notification in the bottom right of your screen indicating that the changes have been applied and allowing you to view them. Click the `View Changes` button to open a diff view of the updated YAML file.

<Warning>

If you edit a model, you must materialize your changes (i.e. run `dbt run`) and then press the **â†»** button at the top of the extension to update your columns.
