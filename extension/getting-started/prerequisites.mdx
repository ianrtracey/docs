## Remedies


Here are some tips on how to remedy the above:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Platform">


We support all modern mac implementations. For Windows users, make sure you have Windows Subsystem for Linux [installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [configured](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) in VSCode. For Codespaces users, please open the [devcontainer locally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_create-a-devcontainerjson-file) to use our extension.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="VS Code version">


Press `Control + Shift + P` within VS Code. Type `Code: Check for Updates` and then install the latest version of VSCode when prompted.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Build tools">


On Mac, open a terminal and run `xcode-select --install`. Note, this may take 20 minutes or more.


On Windows, download the build tools [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Open the downloaded exe and follow the prompts to install Visual C++ build tools.


On Linux,  `sudo apt-get install build-essential` on Debian-based distros and `yum install gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel make` on Fedora-based distros.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Python version">


This depends on how you are managing your Python environment (venv, poetry, etc.). Once you have created a Python environment with Python interpreter version 3.8 or above, press `Control + Shift + P` within VS Code, type `Python: Select Interpreter` and then select the interpreter you have modified/created. You may need to press refresh button in the pane to load the latest environments.


<Tip>

If you are having trouble finding your current interpreter and have dbt already working, you can find the correct path by running `dbt debug` in your terminal  and then looking at the `python_path` that is returned.

<Accordion title="Python packages installed">

Once you have selected the correct interpreter, press `Control + Shift + P` within VS Code, type `Python: Create Terminal` . In the terminal that opens run `pip install dbt-{adapter}` where adapter is the database provider you are using. Here’s a list of [verified](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms) and [community](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/community-adapters) adapters for dbt-core.

<Accordion title="DBT project health">

How to remedy this highly depends on your specific setup, but here are some common fixes:

- Make sure your `packages.yml` file is up to date and corresponds to your dbt version
- Make sure you’ve run `dbt deps`
- Address any repo errors reported when you run `dbt parse` or `dbt compile`
- Make sure that your dbt profile has sufficient database permissions to access the metadata of your development schema
