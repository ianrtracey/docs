| Onboarding fails in the `Runtime` step         | - Make sure you have a Python interpreter set with version 3.9 - 3.11, or 3.9-10 for dbt 1.3<br/>- Confirm you have installed the [appropriate build tools ](/fcd3551f-98d4-4961-a11c-a2ea736da404#8a27b4f8255b4130b0aba702d9c7bc5a)for your operating system<br/>- Make sure you have set the dbt core version and adapter in the `Environment` step                                                                     |
| Onboarding fails during the `dbt Project` step | - Make sure you’ve added your profile _directory_ (if custom), not the path to the `profiles.yml` _file_<br/>- Confirm you’ve added all environmental variables required by your project<br/>- Inspect the logs for the dbt step. These are almost always the errors printed directly from the dbt core cli. Sometimes the issue can be resolved by making a change to the project (e.g. if a model fails to compile) |
