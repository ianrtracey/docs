title: "sample"
---

        Sample a fraction of rows from a table. Results may not be idempotent.

        See specific note from Ibis below:

        Sampling is by definition a random operation. Some backends support specifying a seed for repeatable results, but not all backends support that option. And some backends (duckdb, for example) do support specifying a seed but may still not have repeatable results in all cases.
        In all cases, results are backend-specific. An execution against one backend is unlikely to sample the same rows when executed against a different backend, even with the same seed set.
