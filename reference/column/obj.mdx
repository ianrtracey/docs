## obj.destructure
Destructure a StructValue into the corresponding struct fields.

When assigned, a destruct value will be destructured and assigned to multiple columns.

    
## obj.lift
Project the fields of self into a table.

This method is useful when analyzing data that has deeply nested structs or arrays of structs. lift can be chained to avoid repeating column names and table references.
