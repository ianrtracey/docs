## How to Deploy

Once your project is ready, you can run your transforms, metrics aggregations and enrichments using the CLI command:

```bash
vinyl project deploy
```

After a successful run, the project data is now ready to be served. Data can either be compressed and optimized for sub second queries or serve via a passthrough to your data sources directly.

Run the following to serve your project (default postgres port is `5432` and the HTTP API is `5000`):

```bash
vinyl project serve
```

## Deployment Options

- **Local Deployment** - projects can be ran locally without additional dependencies. This is recommended for development on small datasets.
- **Docker** - use our docker image to deploy your project to any cloud provider or on-premise.
- **Turntable Cloud** - leverage memory-optimized compute, storage and GPUs for fast data workflows and low latency queries

## Performance

We plan to publish official performance benchmarking soon. In our latest internal tests, Vinyl is able to query projects with 100M rows in 300-500ms on a RD7 AWS EC2 instance.
